## MafiaGameEngine

A simple Mafia game that refers to the original card game but with extended variations of roles.

The app is written in C# and uses:
 - NLog NuGet for logs notation;
 - MSTest for, obviously, unit testing;
 - Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) as a first step for visuals;
 - TCP communication for multiplayer connection via the internet.

### ENVIRONMENT

.NET 6.0

### LICENCE

The idea by 'Dark.Revenant'. I as developer do not have any claims on his work, do not consider earning money with it and make this application only with enthusiasm.

The code by 'Kakainchik' and is located as an opensource project on GitHub.
